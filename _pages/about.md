Hi, I'm Antonio Vida, a **passionate Full Stack Developer / Java Software Engineer ** who loves helping people building awesome apps. 

I'm creative, optimistic, dynamic and I enjoy learning new things all the time. I'm interested in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and cloud computing. 

I really like to always challenge myself to improve at everything I do.

Extensive knowledge of professional engineering and coding experience in Java and working in an Agile environment.

Currently, I'm working on a European research project, taking action to help fight climate change. I am **developing Software for improving fire management and wildfires fighting** in
