When you want to run your app configured with *Spring Boot* and it appears this message:

```
Description:

The Tomcat connector configured to listen on port 8080 failed to start. The port may already be in use or the connector may be misconfigured.
```

It is caused because of the port may already be in use or the connector may be misconfigured.

We have two options in this case:

1. Change the port number throught application properties file, addingÂ  the next line:
    ```
    server.port=8081 #Whatever port you want to use
    ```
2. Check if there is a process listening on the port 8080. Identify and stop it.
   1. Open a new cdm window and write:
        ```
        netstat -ano | findstr :8080
        ```
   2. Verify the process that is listening on port 8080 and find out its process id.
   3. Kill the process passing the process id (PID). For example, you get this result:
        ```
        TCP 0.0.0.0:8080 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING 20044
        ```
   4. You have to execute this command, because there is a process listening with the PID 20044.
        ```
        taskkill /PID 20044 /F
        ```
