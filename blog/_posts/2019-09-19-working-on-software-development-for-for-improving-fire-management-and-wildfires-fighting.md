It's a pleasure to work in such an important European project. I'm developing Software for **improving fire management and  wildfires fighting** in [Rural Engineering department at University of Córdoba.](https://www.uco.es/organiza/departamentos/ingforestal/index_en.php) 

The UCO is working within the framework of the [CILIFO project](https://www.keep.eu/project/22856/iberian-center-for-the-forest-investigation-and-firefighting) on an algorithm that will predict the behaviour of forest fires.

Fires are one of the main threats to forests as patrimonial assets. According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, in Spain there are an average of more than 17,000 accidents per year, affecting 113,000 hectares. Although most are contained, and do not spread, uncontrolled fires inflict enormous economic and landscape losses from which it is difficult to recover.
